This is a web scraper for comparing Track and Field Results Reporting Service (TFRRS) cross country results across races.

## Getting Started

Steps for running the code:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Edit tfrrs.py so the meet dictionary contains the links to the TFRRS pages for the meets you want to compare
3. Run python3 tfrrs.py in the appropriate directory
